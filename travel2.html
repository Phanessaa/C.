<h1 >About Peoria</h1>

<p class="wat"> 


    Peoria, Arizona came to be when William J. Murphy, a former Union Army officer, was working as head of construction on the Arizona Canal. Upon the canalâ€™s completion in 1885, Murphy saw the potential for agriculture in the area and returned to Peoria, Illinois where he recruited four families to move out west in November 1886. The official plat map was filed with the County Recorder on March 27, 1897, naming the settlement after their hometown.
