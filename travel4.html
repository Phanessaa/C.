    <blockquote class="wat">After moving to Peoria six years ago I'm blown away by the calm community and great surroundings. As far as views ago, Peoria's got it down with mountains in the horizon. And Arizona sunsets are unmatched. But more importantly the community is made up of families with a diverse background. Personally, I enjoy the courteous nature of the families that make up Peoria. The schools are pretty incredible and give great resources to nurture their students learning. All in all, Peoria is a reliable community for growing families to be comfortable in an being offered great opportunities.
